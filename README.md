###User Interface Design

[Demo](https://hiepvo.github.io/collaboration.modern-developer/)


**Workflow:**

Base on the UI design, we divided User Interface into 2 sections:

1. Non-Setting Section (Jason Rivera):
	* Room Name
	* Roles
	* Colors
	
2. Settings Section (Hiep Vo):
	* Left panel tabs: Chat, Screen Sharing
	* Right panel tabs: Code Editor
